            The main image on the home page was uncompressed, taking longer for you to load the page on your device. The image has been since compressed, allowing you to save at least 1MB in data and have a smoother and faster experience. The image was also causing issues with many android devices either not displaying, or displaying incorrectly. This has been fixed to our knowledge, but if any issues arise, please let us know!

            This update also includes a redesign for the Dashboard app, the Employees app and the Holidays app making sure they look simple and friendly, but can get you where you need to go faster.
